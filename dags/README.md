Create a DAG on your airflow VM instance that does the following:

- [ ]  Runs your ETL/ELT script for the given execution date
- [ ]  Has at least two tasks
- [ ]  At least one task should be dependent on the successful completion of one or more other tasks

(OPTIONAL) Create an Instance Scheduler that does the following:

- [ ]  Starts your airflow vm at a specified time
- [ ]  Turns it off at a specified time

This will help reduce the number of credits you use

Then:

- [ ]  Run your DAG for at least 2 and no more than 5 days
- [ ]  Provide a README in your dags folder in Github explaining where we can find the data generated by your airflow dag
