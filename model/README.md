# Model description

In the file `crypto_model_v1.ipynb` we document all the processes in the making of our model. This base script uses as input the information of the most important crypto in the world: BTC.

The data is taken by querying using BigQuery and extracting important features of the database. From this new source of information, we continue with a feature engineering process.
