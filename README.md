# Project Proposal


## 1. Objectives


We want to build a prediction model about cryptocurrency which can measure and predict market movements based on sentimental analysis extracted from journals and news.


The ML objective is to make good predictions about the cryptocourrency prices and the main purpose for the business objective is to earn more money. 


## 2. Users

People who are interested in making money


## 3. Data Product Architecture Diagram 

## 4.Data

We will gather Data from two API´s:

 - [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)

 -  [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)


We will be able to use the prices from the stock prices and the webpage´s news. Both API´s that will be used are free 


## 5. Modeling

We want to start up with a classification model. The simplest one is the logistic regression working alternatively with a Random Forest classification model.


## 6. Evaluation

## 7. Inference

## 8. Compute

## 9. MVP

## 10. Pre-mortems

The availability of Data could be considered as the main problem
